/*
Node.js can be used in database applications.

One of the most popular databases is MySQL.
*/ 

/*
MySQL Database

To be able to experiment with the code examples, you should have MySQL installed on your computer.

You can download a free MySQL database at https://www.mysql.com/downloads/.
*/ 

/*
Install MySQL Driver

Once you have MySQL up and running on your computer, you can access it by using Node.js.

To access a MySQL database with Node.js, you need a MySQL driver. This tutorial will use the "mysql" module, downloaded from NPM.

To download and install the "mysql" module, open the Command Terminal and execute the following:

C:\Users\Your Name>npm install mysql

Now you have downloaded and installed a mysql database driver.

Node.js can use this module to manipulate the MySQL database:

var mysql = require('mysql');
*/ 

/*
Create Connection

Start by creating a connection to the database.

Use the username and password from your MySQL database.

var mysql = require('mysql');

var con = mysql.createConnection({
  host: "localhost",
  user: "yourusername",
  password: "yourpassword"
});

con.connect(function(err) {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log("Connected!");
});
*/ 

/*
Save the code above in a file called "demo_db_connection.js" and run the file:

Run "demo_db_connection.js"

C:\Users\Your Name>node demo_db_connection.js

Which will give you this result:

Connected!

Now you can start querying the database using SQL statements.
*/ 

/*
Query a Database

Use SQL statements to read from (or write to) a MySQL database. This is also called "to query" the database.

The connection object created in the example above, has a method for querying the database:

con.connect(function(err) {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log("Connected!");
  con.query(sql, function (err, result) {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log("Result: " + result);
  });
});

The query method takes an sql statements as a parameter and returns the result.
